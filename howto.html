        <p><i><strong>In this section, we describe our process in building the first full pairs of glasses. We also
              describe any issues we came across, how we addressed them, and how we updated the design files to mitigate
              them for future iterations.</strong></i></p>

        <h3>A note about Production and Extensibility</h3>

        <p><span>We opted to manufacture our plastics using Nylon PA12 through a selective laser sintering (SLS) 3D
            printing
            process using an external vendor since Nylon is much more resilient and robust than other 3D printing
            materials
            while SLS printing offers a more uniform surface finish. However, we were also able to print all of our
            mechanical components with consumer-grade 3D printers (e.g., Formlabs Form 2, Prusa) so that is an avenue
            that
            is available for quick experimentation.</span></p>

        <p><span>Our two rigid circuit boards were designed with specifications that fit most common circuit board
            manufacturers'
            capabilities (i.e., 4/4mil traces, 4 layers, 0.8mm board thickness, 0.2mm minimum hold sizes, and 1oz
            copper).
            The front flexible PCB is the only design feature which has a custom design feature, specifically having
            transition regions between 2-layers and 4-layers. We worked closely with a manufacturer in Shenzhen on
            producing
            the boards so it is possible other manufacturers may be able to support this feature. Otherwise, you can
            avoid
            the transition altogether and just make a 4-layer flexible PCB which would trade off robustness for added
            simplicity. For circuit board assembly, we were able to assemble a few sets by hand in our lab but many of
            the
            components are small and the front flexible PCB has 2 ball grid array (BGA) components so if lacking the
            soldering capabilities and expertise, an outside assembly service is recommended.</span> </p>

        <p><span>If wanting to add additional sensing modalities, we've added a few thru-hole connections on the PCB
            located on
            the right side that provides 3.3V power, ground, and connections to 3 general purpose input/output pins on
            the
            secondary MCU, equipped with access to the I2C communication and analog-to-digital conversion (ADC)
            peripherals.
            If some of the existing sensing subsystems are not needed for an application, those sensors can be removed
            and
            the existing connections can be re-purposed. One example would be to remove the blink sensor and use the
            existing power and the ADC lines to sample the signal of a different sensor. To make this easier, we've
            added
            various thru-hole regions on the front flexible circuit that wires can be soldered to. Another method that
            can
            be used is removing the PCB with the secondary processor and reusing our existing power circuit to design a
            new
            board with other sensing modalities.</span></p>

        <h3> ALRIGHT! Lets get started! </h3>

        <p> The first thing we did after receiving the PCBs from the manufacturer is inspected them to see if
          anything
          was broken or missing. What we noticed through some quick electrical tests was that the the assembler put on
          the wrong
          LEDs. The 2 LEDs that face toward the eyes and the 2 that illuminate the
          upper
          brows were not activating when a small current was passed through. We found out that the LEDs that were
          attached were common-anode but the ones in
          our
          design were supposed to be common-cathode (p/n: <a
            href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/kingbright/APFA3010SEKJ3ZGKQBKC/5803791">APFA3010SEKJ3ZGKQBKC</a>).
          After contacting them, they informed
          us
          that they had received the wrong LEDs from the supplier and offered to replace them for us. However, due to
          logistical issues of sending them back and paying customs fees and tariffs, we decided to just replace them
          ourselves.
          What that meany is that for each flexible circuit, we had to swap out 4 SMD LEDs. In addition, we also
          needed
          to swap out resistor R6 to 370k since the 453k resistor makes the blink detector too sensitive for real-world
          applications.

        <p> We did have a bit of a bigger issue with the flex circuit that we learned after the circuit was already
          being manufactured.
          Through some iterative testing, we found that we needed to adjust the mechanical design to better position
          the nose sensors to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
          This redesign also made it easier to insert the nose part of the flexible circuit into the mechanical
          housing.
          This meant that the two sections of the flexible PCB that are home to the on-nose sensors needed to be
          redesigned to conform to the new mechanical design.
          (Luckily for anyone working off of our latest design
          files, we’ve updated the final flex PCB layout to include these changes so you don't have to worry about
          this part). Unfortunately for us being on an
          academic budget, we didn’t have the funding to make a new batch of flexible PCBs and get them assembled so
          we had to think creatively.
          As a fix, we just manufactured the redesigned portions of the flexible circuit, snipped off the old nose
          sections of the original batch, and soldered on the new sections
          to the thru-hole pads we left there for future extensibility. This ended up working just fine but we did
          encounter a few issues related to the mechanical forces of snipping off
          the flexible circuit. Given that the whole board is flexible, including the copper layers and all
          intermediary layers, when you cut into the circuit, some of the copper layers can bridge and form shorts or
          partial connections. To mitigate this, we cut the board in a region where the copper traces in each layer
          don't overlap so that they wouldn't touch when cut into but it did take us a few hours to diagnose the
          issue. </p>

        <p>As for the 2 assembled side PCBs, everything looked good and the only thing we had to do is solder on the
          thru-hole thermopile on
          the secondary MCU PCB. We did this to save on assembly cost since it was the only thru-hole component on
          the board but would have dramatically increased assembly cost due to the manual labor required by the
          assembly house to solder the component. </p>

        <h3>Testing the Circuit Board Assembly</h3>
        <p><i>Note: if compiling our code via STM32CubeIDe, you'll likely get a few warnings about the code needing
            regeneration. This is because ST has a helpful utility called STM32Cube that allows you to setup the
            system through a GUI. However, this utility has a tendency of overwriting our custom code so we've
            deviated from relying on it and
            instead have setup peripherals manually using the same code structure that ST uses in their examples so
            its easy to follow. You
            can use the utility for your own application and we recommend doing so if new to embedded systems but it
            may overwrite some of our existing code so use it with caution. </i></p>

        <p>At this point, we recommend testing the circuit electrical assembly prior to putting it in the plastics
          to ensure everything works. Hopefully with the latest board revisions, you shouldn't encounter an issue but
          given the uncertainty of the assembly process and the assembly service you use, its important to check a
          subset of
          your batch to ensure it all works as planned. For us right now, this step will guarantee all the LEDs light
          up as they
          should, the processors
          are successfully flashed, and all the sensor channels work. </p>

        <p>The first thing we will do is flash the secondary MCU. For this, we won't need to connect all three circuit
          boards together since the core power circuitry is on the secondary MCU so as long as we provide 3.7-4.2V
          power into the battery input pins, the circuit will be live. To flash the secondary MCU, you need a
          Tag-Connect
          <a

            cable</a> connected to an <a
            href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2548?gclid=Cj0KCQjwpdqDBhCSARIsAEUJ0hNV4zTqOFKnmYLtB5KbkU3hiRhzKB_xHtgmum8hPvdtDwhtjY-fwsQaAvM3EALw_wcB">ST-LINK
            programmer</a>
          (ref schematic for pinout requirement). Once you power up the board via the battery connections, press the
          connector onto the progamming pins, and flash the <a
            href="https://github.com/mitmedialab/Project-Captivate/blob/master/binaries/stm32_altMCU_Code_v3.bin">binary</a>
          using the <a
            href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html#get-software">STM32CubeProgrammer
            utility</a> or compile the <a
            href="https://github.com/mitmedialab/Project-Captivate/tree/master/stm32_altMCU_Code_v3">code</a> and
          flash it using the <a href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html">STM32CubeIDE
            software</a> <i>(note: make sure the switch is in the ON position which is the position away from the
            connector to the flex circuit).</i> If everything goes right, either utility should finish successfully.
          We
          won't be able to check the sensor channels until we get the remainder of the system connected and
          programmed.
        </p>

        <p>Now we need to connect all three PCBs to be able to program the main MCU. Its recommended that you tape the
          flex down so that it doesn't get strained by any of the programming cables (flex circuits are fragile!). To
          flash the main
          MCU, the process is a bit easier since we were able to fit a USB Micro port. However, this will required
          you to make a custom USB cable where you can remap the pins so that you can connect it directly to an
          ST-LINK. We recommend going on Adafruit or a similar website and procuring a <a
            href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1390?gclid=Cj0KCQjwgtWDBhDZARIsADEKwgPwrU5YFzLyYiGW1X4_XBpB1EgfUyUSdSVbO-zbm-BtwQQNZ-ihFfMaAvO_EALw_wcB">Micro
            USB connector shell </a> that you can easily solder on wires to. Do not connect the 5V line between the
          programmer and the glasses circuit since the
          ST-LINKs aren’t designed to provide a lot of power and can be easily broken by attempting to sink too much
          power.

        <p>Since the main MCU is a dual-core STM32WB55 chip, we need to flash the network processor first and then
          the application processor. ST Microelectronics provides <a
            href="https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubewb.html">binaries</a> to flash the network
          processor with but
          you need to choose the one that your application requires (e.g., Bluetooth and/or OpenThread or Bluetooth
          and/or ZigBee). The binaries we’ve successfuly used with our glasses
          are the <a
            href="https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWB/blob/master/Projects/STM32WB_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/STM32WB5x/stm32wb5x_BLE_Stack_full_fw.bin">BLE
            stack</a>a and the <a
            href="https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWB/blob/master/Projects/STM32WB_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/STM32WB5x/stm32wb5x_Thread_FTD_fw.bin">OpenThread
            stack</a>. We’ve also used the <a
            href="https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWB/blob/master/Projects/STM32WB_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/STM32WB5x/stm32wb5x_BLE_Thread_dynamic_fw.bin">BLE
            & OpenThread concurrent stack </a> and
          modified our latest revision for it but for <a
            href="https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W00000cRqhoSAC/stm32wb-thread-network-goes-down-after-a-few-minutes-in-ble-thread-dynamic-mode-but-ble-stays-active-and-works-fine">reasons
            unknown to us</a>, the OpenThread stack goes down after a
          few minutes of the system being active. In any case, we’re going to focus on the BLE-only binary for this
          tutorial. </p>

        <p>Before flashing, make sure the two side PCBs are connected to the flex and as a reminder, the circuitry is
          secured so
          that you are not adding strain to the flexible circuit. Either with a power supply or a LiPo battery
          (3.7V), apply power to the system via one of the two battery connections (doesn't matter which one since
          they are OR'ed in hardware). To flash the network processor
          binary, you need to download the <a
            href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html">STM32CubeProgrammer</a> application
          and connect the ST-Link to the main MCU via the custom USB cable you made. Follow the instructions on
          flashing the network binary found in the <a
            href="https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWB/blob/master/Projects/STM32WB_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/STM32WB5x/Release_Notes.html">README</a>
          in the STM32WB55 network binary folder. </p>

        <p>Now that we have the network stack flashed, we are ready to flash our main MCU. For LED validation, we
          have a <a
            href="https://github.com/mitmedialab/Project-Captivate/blob/master/binaries/stm32_mainMCU_Code_v5_BLE_slow_LED_seq.bin">custom
            binary</a> we made that you can flash that slowly cycles through all the LEDs so that you
          can tell if
          something needs to be resoldered &#8212 sometimes you might notice one color doesn't activate on an LED so
          you may need to add solder to a pin on the LED corresponding to that color. After that, you can grab the
          latest code for the main MCU on <a
            href="https://github.com/mitmedialab/Project-Captivate/tree/master/stm32_mainMCU_Code_v5">GitHub</a> and
          open it with STM32CubeIDE (or
          your preferred development environment). To validate the sensor channels are all working, uncomment the
          line in captivate_config.h that’s titled TEST_RUN_ON_START which will automatically run the sensor
          channels when powered on. Then, in the MasterThreadTask function in master_thread.c, you can add a
          breakpoint after the
          packetizeData function call and check if sensorPacket is populated with proper data. This is also the thread
          you can
          modify with your own custom sensing architecture since this is the central point for the sensor
          subsystems. If something is wrong, check the electrical connections for that sensing subsystem. <i>(note: we
            do
            not check if the VIVE position system is working in this tutorial since that requires the base stations to
            be setup. Since the circuitry for that is simple, we assume it works.)</i> </p>

        <h3>Plastics Assembly</h3>
        <p>Alright, lets hide the electronics in some plastics! The first thing we’ll do is work on the temple arms.
          For the arm with the main MCU (i.e., the left one), we need to attach two pieces of copper tape for the pogo
          pins on the PCB to make contact with. This contact is for the capacitive touch feature of the glasses. In
          the plastic temple arm, you can see two square cavities for the pieces so just cut them to size and insert
          them with tweezers. It’s recommended to stake the copper (press the copper in at a few points with a pointy
          tweezers) to ensure its in there securely. </p>

        <p>For the batteries, we chose 150mAh batteries we found on AliExpress <a
            href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32797594567.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.7fcb6a6fO1FQBq&algo_pvid=7e69c684-1109-4b58-a35b-50a8c5d7722e&algo_expid=7e69c684-1109-4b58-a35b-50a8c5d7722e-0&btsid=0bb0623f16183644859108832ebb50&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_">(401050)</a>
          but feel free to choose whatever is
          appropriate for your application and modify the cavity size as you wish. We did have to replace the cables
          the batteries came with since they weren’t long enough but that may not be the case with the ones you order.
          Feed the
          battery wires through the internal channel and then solder on the ends to the respected PCB. We recommend
          soldering a longer length of wire than what is needed and then trimming it to the right length after feeding
          it through the internal channel, prior to
          soldering it to the PCBs. This internal channel is only made possible because we 3D printed these glasses so
          if pursuing injection molding, you will need to expose this channel and then cover it after. Also, if 3D
          printing it, the channel can get partially clogged with 3D printing material so you may need to run a solid
          core wire through it a few times to unclog it (we needed to do this for a subset of the plastics). </p>

        <p>Once the batteries are in, you can insert the side PCBs into their respected cavities and solder on the
          wires. Make sure they are oriented so that the flex connector is pointing inward. At this point, you can
          also attach the plastic slider attachment for the switch on the secondary MCU PCB. </p>

        <p>In addition, we need to cut some covers for the batteries so that they aren’t exposed. We chose <a

          because its comfortable against the skin but also allows the batteries some space in case they swell

        <p>Now we can assemble the flex into the front housing. First, we need to prebend the flex slightly to make
          the process a bit easier. Specifically, you will need to gently bend the ends where the Front LED is in a
          stair-step pattern to conform to the inner surface of the front housing. Becareful not to apply any pressure
          on the LED Driver that is in that area since we’ve found
          that it cracks pretty easily because of it being in a chip-scale package (its raw silicon so its brittle).

        <p>Prior to putting the flex circuit in the front housing, we will insert the <a
            href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/bivar-inc/PLPC1-100/5721842">fresnel lenses</a> into the
          plastics. These lenses are necessary since they guide the light from the concealed LED, allowing for a
          greater light transmittance and a wider field-of-view so that the LED can be seen at greater angles. We
          recommend placing them in gently through the front face and then using a flat surface to push them in all
          the way so that they are flush. These lenses deform easily since they are plastic so use a flat surface so
          that you don't distort the lens.</p>

          respected cavity and bend the circuit in real-time to
          conform to the mechanical housing. Then carefully push in the remaining sections of the flexible PCB so that
          they rest snuggly in the plastic. We recommend using soft tweezers so that you don't accidentally cut or rip
          the circuit. Once in, we can now start working on the fiber optics!</p>

        <p>The fiber optics that we chose are designed to illuminate radially instead of just on the ends (i.e.,
          side-glow). To be able to do this, the manufacturer wraps a standard fiber optic cable in a clear teflon
          tube
          that reduces the internal reflectivity of the cable and allows for light to dissipate radially across the
          length
          of
          the light pipe. For our design, we need to remove part of this teflon tubing so that the fiber can be
          inserted
          tightly into the top of the glasses, allowing for a more streamlined look. We only leave the teflon tubing
          on the fiber where it is exposed to increase the radial transmittance at those locations. Its important that
          the fiber being
          inserted makes contact
          with the LED that illuminates it to reduce internal light loss and maximize the light transfer from the LED
          into the fiber. </p>

        <p>We’re now ready to snap on the back cover for the front housing. Bend the two pieces of flex that are
          intended to run through the hinge so that they are outward facing and then insert the cover. The back cover
          will bend slightly when being inserted but should snap into place. The back cover
          also has 4 supporting <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/96001A056/">No. 00 screws</a> that self-tap into the plastic but we’ve found them to be unnecessary for our
          use but feel free to include them for added robustness.</p>

        <p>Now that the back cover is on, we will attach the temple arms. For each temple arm, we have a screw for the
          top and the bottom that self-taps into the plastics. For the top screw, we have an additional <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/92510A414/">spacer</a> to
          reduce any movement due to torquing of the arms. Insert one arm into the front housing hinge, attach the
          flex cable to the rigid side PCB, insert back cover for that temple arm, and then insert the <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/96001A149/">No. 2 screws</a>. Repeat
          for the other arm. </p>
